# Project Quarantine

(Development period: March 2020 - August 2020)

Project Quarantine is a stealth game where you have to gather resources to keep your family alive in a city in total lockdown, complete with police officers roaming the streets, and total riot. This project was made for the Design & Production class in the third semester of Game Development in Escuela Da Vinci, Argentina. We learned how to effectively manage tasks and time in a limited timespan, as well as striving for best design practices.
